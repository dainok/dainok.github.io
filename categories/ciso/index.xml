Yet, the reality is that managing vulnerabilities remains a significant challenge for most organizations.</description></item><item><title>Assume breach design</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2024/10/12/assume-breach-design/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2024/10/12/assume-breach-design/</guid><description>There is much discussion around Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), but it seems the concept of Assume Breach Design has yet to be formalized. Or, at least, a Google search does not yield results.</description></item><item><title>ICS/OT/IoT Security: challenges and protection strategies</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2024/09/05/ics/ot/iot-security-challenges-and-protection-strategies/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2024/09/05/ics/ot/iot-security-challenges-and-protection-strategies/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to revisit the ICS/OT world, as it has unique characteristics that influence its processes and tools.
First, I would categorize this broad field into the following groups:

The scenarios described are always based on real cases, modified to make them unrecognizable while still usable as tabletop exercises.</description></item><item><title>Opt-out from Web Archive</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2024/04/29/opt-out-from-web-archive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2024/04/29/opt-out-from-web-archive/</guid><description>Web Archive is an online service (non-profit) that has long been recording various websites by archiving them in a virtually permanent manner so that anyone can analyze the history and changes of a specific website.</description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity: fashion or strategy</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2024/04/11/cybersecurity-fashion-or-strategy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2024/04/11/cybersecurity-fashion-or-strategy/</guid><description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a suitable title for this post, in which I try to gather various insights that I&amp;rsquo;ve received in the past few days and that I&amp;rsquo;ve planned, sooner or later, to discuss together with Rocco Sicilia.</description></item><item><title>Securing user authentication under IEC 62443 in OT</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/06/15/securing-user-authentication-under-iec-62443-in-ot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/06/15/securing-user-authentication-under-iec-62443-in-ot/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m discussing the IEC 62443 certification with an organization: that build and sell ICS plants which are risky from a safety perspective. They currently comply with the Machinery Directive (Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament), but they are not considering the Cyber risk.</description></item><item><title>What does it take to secure any SME organization?</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/05/25/what-does-it-take-to-secure-any-sme-organization/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/05/25/what-does-it-take-to-secure-any-sme-organization/</guid><description>Managing Cybersecurity is expensive, we all know that. But not managing it is also more expensive. Given my experience, an SME recovers from a critical Cyberattack in 5-10 days, if it can recover (yes I also personally know companies that lost everything because of a Cyberattack).</description></item><item><title>Log management is more than a log collector</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/05/20/log-management-is-more-than-a-log-collector/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/05/20/log-management-is-more-than-a-log-collector/</guid><description>Many companies (hopefully) are collecting logs in a central system. The reason besides that is for compliance and sometimes for root cause analysis. In this post, I want to recap that log management is not just about log collections, and why and how the process should be designed.</description></item><item><title>The value of a Risk Based VA</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/05/18/the-value-of-a-risk-based-va/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/05/18/the-value-of-a-risk-based-va/</guid><description>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m explaining why we are executing VA, why the traditional approach is dangerous and how we should manage the risk bound to vulnerabilities.
I&amp;rsquo;m also discussing a few false myths about VA.</description></item><item><title>VA scanners for patch management: good or bad?</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/03/29/va-scanners-for-patch-management-good-or-bad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/03/29/va-scanners-for-patch-management-good-or-bad/</guid><description>Nowadays (hopefully) all companies are executing regular vulnerability assessments. They often use different partners/tools each year and they often limit themselves to vulnerability assessments.
VAs are not the end of a security strategy, they are just a small step at the beginning.</description></item><item><title>Approaching OT/ICS Cybersecurity</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/03/28/approaching-ot/ics-cybersecurity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/03/28/approaching-ot/ics-cybersecurity/</guid><description>A few days ago, together with Rocco Sicilia and FESTO Academy , I presented a webinar on OT/ICS Cybersecurity approach.

That was the moment when companies should have immediately triggered a risk assessment, followed by a business impact analysis and an actionable response plan.</description></item><item><title>Training in managing cyber attacks</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2021/03/03/training-in-managing-cyber-attacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2021/03/03/training-in-managing-cyber-attacks/</guid><description>A cyber attack against a company can feel very similar to a terrorist attack.
