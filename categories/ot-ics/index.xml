They currently comply with the Machinery Directive (Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament), but they are not considering the Cyber risk.</description></item><item><title>Virtual PLC lab for Cybersecurity scenarios</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/04/03/virtual-plc-lab-for-cybersecurity-scenarios/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/04/03/virtual-plc-lab-for-cybersecurity-scenarios/</guid><description>As you probably know, I&amp;rsquo;m working on learning simulated lab for years. In the last couple of years, I moved to OT/ICS Cybersecurity, and sometimes I need a realistic lab to show the consequence of a Cyberattack targeting OT/ICS devices.</description></item><item><title>Approaching OT/ICS Cybersecurity</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/03/28/approaching-ot/ics-cybersecurity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/03/28/approaching-ot/ics-cybersecurity/</guid><description>A few days ago, together with Rocco Sicilia and FESTO Academy , I presented a webinar on OT/ICS Cybersecurity approach. We are often spending time increasing Cybersecurity awareness, and that webinar was focused to gives Cybersecurity fundamentals to OT managers.</description></item><item><title>Write-up Attacking ICS Plant 2</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2020/12/24/write-up-attacking-ics-plant-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2020/12/24/write-up-attacking-ics-plant-2/</guid><description>This post explore my second TryHackMe room: Attacking ICS Plant #2 . Because the VM can be unresponsive, I also provide the OVA for offline labs.
The room allows attacking a simulated refinery plant, gaining basic knowledge on ICS protocol weakness.</description></item><item><title>Write-up Attacking ICS Plant 1</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2020/12/02/write-up-attacking-ics-plant-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2020/12/02/write-up-attacking-ics-plant-1/</guid><description>This post explore my first TryHackMe room: Attacking ICS Plant #1 . Because the VM can be unresponsive, I also provide the OVA for offline labs.
The room allows exploration of a simulated bottle-filling plant, gaining basic knowledge on ICS protocol weakness.</description></item></channel></rss>
