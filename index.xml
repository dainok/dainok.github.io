By default, Cisco ACI pagination allows you to retrieve up to 500 objects. A maximum value is not explicitly documented ; however, it is not recommended to go beyond this limit in order to avoid overloading the APIC.</description></item><item><title>Filtering Cisco API Output</title><link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2026/01/11/filtering-cisco-api-output/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2026/01/11/filtering-cisco-api-output/</guid><description>Previously, we created a simple script to print a table of CDP neighbors for all interfaces in the fabric.
